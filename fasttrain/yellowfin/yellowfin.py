      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        '''
        clip thresh is the threshold value on ||lr * gradient||
        delta_mu can be place holder/variable/python scalar. They are used for additional
        momentum in situations such as asynchronous-parallel training. The default is 0.0
        for basic usage of the optimizer.
        Args:
          lr: python scalar. The initial value of learning rate, we use 1.0 in our paper.
          mu: python scalar. The initial value of momentum, we use 0.0 in our paper.
          clip_thresh: python scalar. The manaully-set clipping threshold for tf.clip_by_global_norm.
            if None, the automatic clipping can be carried out. The automatic clipping
            feature is parameterized by argument auto_clip_fac. The auto clip feature
            can be switched off with auto_clip_fac = None
          beta: python scalar. The smoothing parameter for estimations.
          sparsity_debias: gradient norm and curvature are biased to larger values when
          calculated with sparse gradient. This is useful when the model is very sparse,
          e.g. LSTM with word embedding. For non-sparse CNN, turning it off could slightly
          accelerate the speed.
          delta_mu: for extensions. Not necessary in the basic use.
          force_non_inc_step: in some very rare cases, it is necessary to force ||lr * gradient||
          to be not increasing dramatically for stableness after some iterations.
          In practice, if turned on, we enforce lr * sqrt(smoothed ||grad||^2)
          to be less than 2x of the minimal value of historical value on smoothed || lr * grad ||.
          This feature is turned off by default.
          checkpoint_interval: interval to do checkpointing. For potential recovery from crashing.
          stat_protect_fac: a loose hard adaptive threshold over ||grad||^2. It is to protect stat
          from being destropied by exploding gradient.
        Other features:
          If you want to manually control the learning rates, self.lr_factor is
          an interface to the outside, it is an multiplier for the internal learning rate
          in YellowFin. It is helpful when you want to do additional hand tuning
          or some decaying scheme to the tuned learning rate in YellowFin.
